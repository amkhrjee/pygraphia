PyGraphia aims to be a minimalist graph library to help you implement graph algorithms out of the box. 

It also comes with its own implementations of few popular graph algorithms. 

The main goals are following:
- Provide a robust `Graph` data type.
- Provide useful util functions/properties to be used out of the box.
- Keep it simple and straightforward.

PyGraphia is under construction and not released on any package repository.
